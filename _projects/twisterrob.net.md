## Intro
The purpose of this website is to have a one-stop-shop for information about me and my projects in a structured way.
This website is a long-waited upgrade from my old website that we hacked together at the beginning of University. I pretty much stopped maintaining it ~10 years ago. Iâ€™m planning to migrate content over to this new site.
I've created many things that are useful for some, but they're undiscoverable because there are no external links pointing to them.

## Implementation
In the beginning I just wanted to merge my Blogger blog to Jekyll, luckily I found a great base theme in [Feeling Responsive](http://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/) with just enough to start me off. As I dug deeper and deeper into it, I found that it's a really good platform for informational websites with static content. The best part is the versatile language support with Markdown for content, I can use HTML when needed, and I have the ability to script via Liquid and also the built-in GitHub pages hosting support is not negligible.

## Layout

### Work
In this part of the site I'm listing all my working experience that is referenced in my CV.

### Products
Lists my projects that are available online for download and use. I try to write some meaningful description and screenshots for each product, for some this is the manual. I also include screenshots, because there's no worse product description than text. A picture of it in action is a must in my opinion to see if I want to go through the labor of installing it.

### Blog
Things I want to share with general public or reference from somewhere else.

While Jekyll doesn't really have built-in support for tags and categories as a navigation aid, I managed to polyfill most of the needed code that allows for easy navigation around the posts. After all, this Internet thing started out with some really simple linked HTML pages.
