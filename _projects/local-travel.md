## Inception

### First idea
Few years ago when I was looking for rents it came up that I don't want to commute more than 20 minutes. It was hard to look for rents, because I didn't really know London and most of the websites don't have the best map experience when searching. So I went ahead and used TfL's public data to build myself an app that can help. I can easily set up my parameters and see immediate visual feedback of good places to live.

### Future
In the future I want to create an app that looks differently at local travel, one that departs from the usual, status updates, current schedule and two-point routing. Sadly this requires time, but I hope I'll get there eventually.

## Details
To find more info about the current state of the app, go to the Google Play Store and read the description.

## Line status history
When looking at the data available from TfL, I found that it publishes the line statuses. Sometimes I had the urge to see what's going on in the city. For example at times of a bigger snowfall, storm, or just a sports event. By the time I found out the status was most of the time already back to normal. The website linked above allows you to see what was happening in the past.
