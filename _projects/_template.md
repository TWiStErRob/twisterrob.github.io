## Inception

### Motivation

### Kickoff

### Goals
I set my goals to include the features deemed most important to me:

 * free hierarchy
 * categories
 * record pictures for the items
 * searchable
 * fast entry, navigation and edit

... and left some features to the future:

 * import/export from/to other apps (though there's still ability to backup and share the full inventory)
 * multiple images per item
 * specialized fields (color, brand, price, ...)

I'm curious to see which of these pop up in reviews.

## Implementation
