A <dfn>bookmarklet</dfn> is a script that stays on the <mark>Bookmarks Bar</mark> waiting to be clicked to execute.  
    To use a bookmarklet:

     1. Drag and drop the link to the <mark>Bookmarks Bar</mark>.
     1. Navigate to the page it's designed to run on.
     1. Click it to execute.

    Bookmarklets tend to rot over time if the owner changes the website, please [report to me]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact) if it's broken.
