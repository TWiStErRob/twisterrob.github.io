I created this blog more than half a year ago and a lot of convetion I tried to introduce was lost in memory. This document will help to remember what's possible and how it will look like.

It should also help to quickly test if formatting would break with any future updates of the site.

## TL;DR
{: .no_toc }
*[TL;DR]: Too Long; Didn't Read

This heading is not part of the [TOC](#toc). All headings can be linked via their short name: [this heading](#tldr).


{% include toc.md %}

## Formatting
*[abbr]: abbreviation

 * Belonging words should have `&nbsp;` between to prevent wrapping: Papp&nbsp;RÃ³bert.
 * Long list of alternatives should have `<wbr>` between them to allow wrapping: this&nbsp;one<wbr>/that&nbsp;one<wbr>/other&nbsp;thing
 * Use `<samp>` for sample output: <samp>Exit code: 1</samp>.
 * Use `<samp>` for math: <samp>4&nbsp;people &times; 5&nbsp;days = 20&nbsp;man hours</samp>.
 * Use `<var>` for something representing a number: <var>your age</var> times.
 * Use `<mark>` for callout <mark>Grammar&nbsp;Nazis</mark>
 * Use `<mark>` for UI elements: Press <mark>Next</mark> to proceed.
 * Use `<abbr>` to show an abbreviation: <abbr title="shortended text">shot</abbr>, but it's not necessary if the abbr is defined in markdown
 * Custom colors when referencing something highlighted on an image: <span style="color:cyan">Save button</span>.


## Code

 * File extensions with `<code>`: `.css`, `.js`, `.html`
 * Paths and file names with `<samp>`: <samp>lib/code/path/file.name</samp>
 * Liquid-like code may need some escaping: {%raw%}`{{tag}}`{%endraw%}
 * Fencing code blocks' ticks can be output like this: ````<code>```</code>```` &rarr; <code>```</code>.
 * Don't be lazy with `alternative`/`code`/`formatting`.


### Normal code block

```java
/** Comment */
public void method();
```

*Some extra explanation to help understand the code.*


### Code block with title

```java
/** Comment */
public void method();
```
{: title="Short description of the code block"}


### Code block with Liquid code

```liquid{% raw %}
{% for tag in site.data.tags %}<li>{{ tag.name }}{% unless forloop.last %}, {% endunless %}</li>{% endfor %}
```{% endraw %}
{: title="Liquid code, that's not executed"}
{% comment %}Outputting `endraw` in code block requires some trickery: http://blog.slaks.net/2013-06-10/jekyll-endraw-in-code/{% endcomment %}

### Code block for shell

```shell
me@laptop$ command args "more args"
output text from command
though output may be highlighted weirdly
```

## Quotes

Here's a <q>short quotation</q> which is in the middle of a sentence.

> This is a long quotation by someone, normal markdown formatting rules apply:  
  **strong**, *em*, _em_, ***strong em***, <b>html bold</b>, `code`, <kbd>kbd</kbd>, <samp>samp</samp>, <ins>ins</ins>, <del>del</del>
  <cite>TWiStErRob</cite>

> <samp>Program output text</samp> <cite>output from [file.name](http://sources.com/path/to/file.name#line=123) in [library](http://library.com/)</cite>


## Alerts
All `alert`s support markdown and their names are all lowercase, because they're used as CSS classes, for example TODO is `alert todo=`. The <q>TODO:</q> prefix is not automatically inserted, it's for name calling only here.
{% include alert alert='Alert:  
    This is like any normal markdown, even when used from non-markdown context:  
    **strong**, *em*, _em_, ***strong em***, <b>html bold</b>, `code`, <kbd>kbd</kbd>, <samp>samp</samp>, <ins>ins</ins>, <del>del</del>.' %}

{% include alert warning='Warning: call out a caveat that\'s easy to trigger
