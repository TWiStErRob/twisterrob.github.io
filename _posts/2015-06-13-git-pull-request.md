Many times when you ask for a feature in a GitHub issue, you're welcomed with:

> Can you create a PR please?

... even if it's a one-character typo. Here's how I create a PR.

## What is a PR?
A <dfn>Pull&nbsp;Request</dfn> is request created on GitHub to merge code from one fork of the repository to another. Usually there's a feature/bug branch in the fork and the PR is made against the `master` branch &mdash;, or wherever their `HEAD` commit is &mdash; in the base repository.

## GitHub setup

As easy as pressing ![Fork button on GitHub](data:image/png;base64,

).

## Checkout

Click the [HTTPS](javascript:;) link below the clone URL box and then copy the ***HTTPS** clone URL* which can be then used to clone a repo:

```shell
me@laptop$ git clone https://github.com/me/repo-name.git .
Cloning into '.'...
```

Immediately after this I go back to the original repository (where I forked from) and repeat the [HTTPS](#) link copying and add the remote:

```shell
me@laptop$ git remote add -f mint https://github.com/stranger/repo-name.git # -f == immediate fetch
Updating mint
me@laptop$ git remote set-url --push mint DISALLOWED
```

This is useful if the original repo is active and you want to keep up to date. I call it `mint` (after the adjective in "mint&nbsp;condition"), because the normal clone operation creates an `origin` remote, also mint suggests to keep it clean.

```shell
me@laptop$ git remote -v # == git remote --verbose show
mint    https://github.com/stranger/repo-name.git (fetch)
mint    DISALLOWED (push)
origin  https://github.com/me/repo-name.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/me/repo-name.git (push)
```

## Update remote

`stranger-head-branch` is usually the `master` branch and `my-pr-branch`'s name is highly correlated with what your PR is representing.

```shell
me@laptop$ git checkout stranger-head-branch
Switched to branch 'stranger-head-branch'

me@laptop$ git merge mint/stranger-head-branch
Updating abc1230..abc123f
Fast-forward
...

me@laptop$ git checkout my-pr-branch
Switched to branch 'my-pr-branch'

me@laptop$ git rebase stranger-head-branch
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: Commit message 1
Applying: Commit message 2
...
```

## Create PR

```shell
me@laptop$ git push --all
```

Upon success just go to the original repo or your fork on GitHub and you should see a <mark>Your recently pushed branches:</mark> tip with a <mark>Compare & pull request<mark> button.

Review changes, fill in description and you're good to go.

## Future of a PR
If the repository owners like what you did and it adheres to rules usually defined in `CONTRIBUTING.md` they'll merge your PR and you'll see a <mark>Pull request successfully merged and closed</mark> message with a <mark>Delete branch</mark> button next to it. That helps to keep your fork's working branches to a minimum. Once it's merged the commits are copied to their repository so it's safe to delete your branch.

There's of course the possibility that something goes wrong, like the CI build fails or there's some modification needed in the PR. In that case make some more commits to your fork, or even rebase or squash commits; then push it to the working branch and the PR will be updated automatically.
