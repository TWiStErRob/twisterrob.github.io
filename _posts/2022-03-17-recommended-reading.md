Collection of things I've read during the years, and I keep referring back to them.<!--more--> I either agree with their content, or they have material I can refer back to. These articles have made me a better software engineer, colleague or just straight up person.

Let's start with a quick baseline that should be(come) common sense:
 * [nohello: please don't say just hello in chat](https://nohello.net/)  
   (probably the original version: https://www.nohello.com/)
 * [Don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)
 * [The XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info)
 * [Zac Sweers: You are not blocked](https://www.zacsweers.dev/you-are-not-blocked/)

The pages are in no particular order, just randomly thrown here.
If I get inspiration I might write some actual recommendations, until then, just read on!
