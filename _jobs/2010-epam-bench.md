> In the outsourcing world *bench* refers to group of resources who are not assigned to any project, but ready to be used immediately when the need arises.

After my last project I was put on "bench". I was learning new technologies and deepening my existing knowledge, for example:

 * read books and articles about Java concurrency
 * created a web application in Zend Framework backed by MySQL
 * learned about graph databases
 * watched Channel 9 videos about WPF, Windows 8, and software development
 * prototyped some ideas based on the things I learned

**Technologies**: PHP, Zend Framework, MySQL, Java, .NET, WPF

**Tools used**: Eclipse, Visual Studio
