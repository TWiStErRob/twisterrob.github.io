I was working with a global financial services provider. The team was responsible for developing and maintaining an Oracle based data warehouse and the corresponding user interface in SmartGWT. The database was a temporal database providing historical audit data for any given time. We’ve done several data migration exercises within the database. There were upstream and downstream service dependencies providing partial data and expecting data from our system. Data was flowing near real time between the systems. I’ve worked closely with the Business Analyst to specify requirements.

**Technologies**: Java, Oracle, Hibernate, SmartGWT, Spring, JUnit, Tibco EMS, Tomcat, JavaScript  
**Tools used**: Scrum Sprints, Jira, Maven, TeamCity, Sonar, SQL Explorer, Oracle SQL Developer
