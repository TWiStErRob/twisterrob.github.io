There was no good schedule information for my city in a digital, easily accessible form so I decided to create an application for my recently acquired HTC phone running Android. In the making I tried to generalize the concepts to be easily adaptable for other cities’/regions’ transportation services.

**Technologies and tools**: Java, Android, XML, Eclipse, HTMLTidy library, Google Maps
