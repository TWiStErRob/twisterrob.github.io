Glide is an extremely customizable efficient image loading library for Android. I first come into contact with it when I started developing [Magic Home Inventory]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/inventory/) and I fell in love with it. So I decided to start contributing to it to make it even better. I learned using Git, IntelliJ IDEA and GitHub in the process. Most of my contributions were aimed on easing Sam's workload so he can fulfill his vision about Glide and maintain it more easily. I helped investigating and resolving [more than 900 issues](https://github.com/bumptech/glide/issues?q=involves%3Atwisterrob) and [80 questions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/glidelibrary), and contributed [more than 50 commits](https://github.com/bumptech/glide/commits?author=TWiStErRob) in the past two years, checking in every day.
