After my last job I planned to take a short break of a few months which extended to more than a year. I was developing new applications, learning new technologies, cleaning up my environment. Most of the work I've done involved Android, the Web, and various open-source projects on GitHub.

 * **Email cleanup**  
   I cleaned up my old mailboxes, folders and labels; migrating about 10000 emails and manually deleting more than 30000 useless notifications and subscriptions. I also properly introduced the empty inbox policy, and a better workflow, to deal with incomming messages really quickly.

   * I solved
     * 200+ problems on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/twisterrob)
     * numerous challenges on [hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/TWiStErRob)
