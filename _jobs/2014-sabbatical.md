After my last job I planned to take a short break of a few months which extended to more than a year. I was developing new applications, learning new technologies, cleaning up my environment. Most of the work I've done involved Android, the Web, and various open-source projects on GitHub.

Most notable projects are:

 * [My website]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/)  
   based on Jekyll. Reimagination and port of my former Blog and Website.
 * [Magic Home Inventory]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/inventory/)  
   Android app to inventory anything in your home.  
   Of course I made an inventory of all my belongings totalling to more than 1600 items.
 * [Android Color Filters]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/color-filters/)  
   Android app to test Android Color Filters with live preview.
 * [Sun Position Widget]({{ site.baseurl }}/project/sun-widget/)  
   Android widget to show the Sun's angle.
 * [Glide]({{ site.baseurl }}/work/2014-glide/)  
   code contributions and issue support.
 * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/253468/twisterrob?tab=profile)  
   I achieved top 2% during the 2014 -- 2015 period, mostly under *Android*, *Java* and *Gradle* tags.
 * Android Gradle plugin  
   an advanced Gradle build plugin to help streamline my Android projects' build process and countless build scripts.
 * Gradle Build graph visualization  
   to display task as they're running, which helps to see progress visually
 * Email cleanup  
   I cleaned up my old mailboxes, folders and labels; migrating about 10000 emails and manually deleting more than 30000 useless notifications and subscriptions.  
   *Google's [GMail Search expressions](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190) and [keyboard shortcuts](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594) are awesome!*

During these projects I reported numerous bugs and issues at the appropriate places and contributed some PRs as well.

**Technologies**: Android, Java, Gradle, Ruby, Liquid, HTML, CSS, SASS

**Tools used**: Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Jekyll, Chrome Developer Tools, Sublime Text
