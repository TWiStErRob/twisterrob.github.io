Capable of displaying GPS tracks loaded from different formats and then placing analytical marks on them. After the user analyzed the track, there's a possibility of exporting both the marker setup and the resulting track in KML. The internals are written in an extensible way, making it very easy to define new types of track importers, marker placement strategies, and track exporters; even allowing 3rd parties to do that with a plugin framework.

**Technologies**: .NET, WPF, Google Earth (API), several GPS track file formats, KML
