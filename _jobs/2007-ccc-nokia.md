I was part of few continuous Java projects as a developer and tester. The projects were driven by one of the world's largest mobile phone makers; the product helped customers of the company to brand their phones. My responsibilities included manual testing and writing JUnit tests as well as implementing features and fixing bugs in complex desktop applications. I also improved code quality by refactoring some code and introduced Java 5's generics. All written communications were done in English between me and the customer and team members.
